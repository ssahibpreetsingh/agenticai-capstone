04_generate_grounded.py — Module 3 (Prompt Engineering) + Module 4.9 (Grounded Generation)

GOAL: Take retrieved chunks from Stage 3, build a well-structured prompt (role,
instruction, context, constraints, output format — Module 3.1), and generate a
grounded answer that:
    1. Only uses information present in the retrieved chunks
    2. Cites which source document(s) it used
    3. Explicitly abstains ("I don't have enough information...") if the retrieved
       chunks don't actually answer the question — this is your hallucination
       mitigation (Module 2.7 / 4.9)

Time budget: ~20 minutes

CONSTRAINTS:
- Answer ONLY using the information in the CONTEXT section below.
- If the context does not contain enough information to answer confidently, say so
  explicitly ("I don't have enough information to answer that precisely — please
  contact [support/your care team] directly") rather than guessing.
- If the question describes what could be a medical or financial emergency
  (e.g. severe symptoms, active fraud in progress), prioritise directing the user to
  the appropriate emergency/urgent channel over answering the informational question.
- Always cite which source file(s) you used at the end of your answer, like:
  "Sources: loan_policy.txt, faq_emi.txt"
- Keep answers concise: 2-5 sentences plus the source citation line.
